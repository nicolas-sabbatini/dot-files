#: Mouse actions {{{

#: Mouse buttons can be remapped to perform arbitrary actions. The
#: syntax for doing so is:

#: .. code-block:: none

#:     mouse_map button-name event-type modes action

#: Where ``button-name`` is one of ``left``, ``middle``, ``right`` or
#: ``b1 ... b8`` with added keyboard modifiers, for example:
#: ``ctrl+shift+left`` refers to holding the ctrl+shift keys while
#: clicking with the left mouse button. The number ``b1 ... b8`` can
#: be used to refer to upto eight buttons on a mouse.

#: ``event-type`` is one ``press``, ``release``, ``doublepress``,
#: ``triplepress``, ``click`` and ``doubleclick``.  ``modes``
#: indicates whether the action is performed when the mouse is grabbed
#: by the program running in the terminal, or not. It can have one or
#: more or the values, ``grabbed,ungrabbed``. ``grabbed`` refers to
#: when the program running in the terminal has requested mouse
#: events. Note that the click and double click events have a delay of
#: click_interval to disambiguate from double and triple presses.

#: You can run kitty with the kitty --debug-input command line option
#: to see mouse events. See the builtin actions below to get a sense
#: of what is possible.

#: If you want to unmap an action map it to ``no-op``. For example, to
#: disable opening of URLs with a plain click::

#:     mouse_map left click ungrabbed no-op

#: .. note::
#:     Once a selection is started, releasing the button that started it will
#:     automatically end it and no release event will be dispatched.

# clear_all_mouse_actions no

#: You can have kitty remove all mouse actions seen up to this point.
#: Useful, for instance, to remove the default mouse actions.

#: Click the link under the mouse or move the cursor

# mouse_map left click ungrabbed mouse_handle_click selection link prompt

#::  First check for a selection and if one exists do nothing. Then
#::  check for a link under the mouse cursor and if one exists, click
#::  it. Finally check if the click happened at the current shell
#::  prompt and if so, move the cursor to the click location. Note
#::  that this requires shell-integration to work.

#: Click the link under the mouse or move the cursor even when grabbed

# mouse_map shift+left click grabbed,ungrabbed mouse_handle_click selection link prompt

#::  Same as above, except that the action is performed even when the
#::  mouse is grabbed by the program running in the terminal.

#: Click the link under the mouse cursor

# mouse_map ctrl+shift+left release grabbed,ungrabbed mouse_handle_click link

#::  Variant with ctrl+shift is present because the simple click based
#::  version has an unavoidable delay of click_interval, to
#::  disambiguate clicks from double clicks.

#: Discard press event for link click

# mouse_map ctrl+shift+left press grabbed discard_event

#::  Prevent this press event from being sent to the program that has
#::  grabbed the mouse, as the corresponding release event is used to
#::  open a URL.

#: Paste from the primary selection

# mouse_map middle release ungrabbed paste_from_selection

#: Start selecting text

# mouse_map left press ungrabbed mouse_selection normal

#: Start selecting text in a rectangle

# mouse_map ctrl+alt+left press ungrabbed mouse_selection rectangle

#: Select a word

# mouse_map left doublepress ungrabbed mouse_selection word

#: Select a line

# mouse_map left triplepress ungrabbed mouse_selection line

#::  Select the entire line

#: Select line from point

# mouse_map ctrl+alt+left triplepress ungrabbed mouse_selection line_from_point

#::  Select from the clicked point to the end of the line

#: Extend the current selection

# mouse_map right press ungrabbed mouse_selection extend

#::  If you want only the end of the selection to be moved instead of
#::  the nearest boundary, use move-end instead of extend.

#: Paste from the primary selection even when grabbed

# mouse_map shift+middle release ungrabbed,grabbed paste_selection
# mouse_map shift+middle press grabbed discard_event

#: Start selecting text even when grabbed

# mouse_map shift+left press ungrabbed,grabbed mouse_selection normal

#: Start selecting text in a rectangle even when grabbed

# mouse_map ctrl+shift+alt+left press ungrabbed,grabbed mouse_selection rectangle

#: Select a word even when grabbed

# mouse_map shift+left doublepress ungrabbed,grabbed mouse_selection word

#: Select a line even when grabbed

# mouse_map shift+left triplepress ungrabbed,grabbed mouse_selection line

#::  Select the entire line

#: Select line from point even when grabbed

# mouse_map ctrl+shift+alt+left triplepress ungrabbed,grabbed mouse_selection line_from_point

#::  Select from the clicked point to the end of the line

#: Extend the current selection even when grabbed

# mouse_map shift+right press ungrabbed,grabbed mouse_selection extend

#: Show clicked command output in pager

# mouse_map ctrl+shift+right press ungrabbed mouse_show_command_output

#::  Requires https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/ to
#::  work
